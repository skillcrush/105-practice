                <h4>It's ok to feel lost!</h4>

                <p>Getting lost and feeling confused is a very important part of learning. It gives us the opportunity to look for the solution. Taking that time to research or ask a friend or teacher, helps the information really stick in your head. What you learn in those circumstances become very easy to remember. When this happens, take a breath, embrace the challenge and know that what you learn, you will never forget.</p>

                <h4>What is it that you want to do?</h4>

                <p>When I decided to change careers and go into Tech, I started making a list of everything that I wanted to do, everything that I wanted to learn and all the new jobs that I wanted to get. If I ever feel stuck or overwhelmed I remember my list and I think about how excited I am to do and learn everything that I have planed. It helps me to stay calm and to keep focused because this IS EXCITING!! <span>And if it were too easy, it would be boring.</span></p>

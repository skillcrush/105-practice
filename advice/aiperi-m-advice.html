                <h4>Be patient with yourself!</h4>
                <p>When you start learning a new programming language, it's going to be hard and it gets more confusing &amp; challenging along the way. I haven't yet met anyone for whom learning coding was easy, so be patient and keep moving forward. Do not ever give up and always ask for help if you need one!</p>
 
                <h4>Support from Instructors &amp; peers is very important!</h4>
                <p>Honestly, I don't know if I would keep moving forward and studying if I didn't have all the support from my Skillcrush inctructors. They are so helpful &amp; supportive whenever I'm stuck or confused. Also, my husband is always there for me and inspires me to believe in myself and that I can do it! Really grateful for them! </p>

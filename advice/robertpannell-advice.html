        <p>Hello there! I am Robert, as stated above, and I just wanted to share some brief advice with you.
          Coding is a challenging career to try to get started in, but I am discovering that there is such
          a vast amount of information available that practically anybody can learn that wants to take the time!
          Is that you?!</p>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>If you are anything like me then the hardest part of doing anything is getting myself motivated
          to do it. Coding has been no different. Some evenings the last thing that I want to do is sit down
          and study how to code anything. The struggle is real. This, however, is something that can be overcome.
          Having a specific time every day that I do my coding practice really helps me to get myself going every
          evening. Maybe it would help motivate you as well to know exactly what time of day you are you going to dedicate
          to your study.</p>

        <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
        <p>What I have found to be the most important things for learning to code is just being willing to show up
          and do the work. If you can make yourself do the studying and practicing every day then there is no way that
          you won't improve. Determination can be the make or break for any new skill, but I know that if we have made
          it this far then we can definitely make it to our goals. Set a schedule, do the work, get your goals!
          <strong>We got this!</strong></p>

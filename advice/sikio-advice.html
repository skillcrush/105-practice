            <h4>Practice Presistence</h4>
            <p> The act of trying, even a little bit of coding everday or on an unnegotiable schedule is really important. Like any muscle training such mental exercises strengthen your learning, interest and confidence in coding.Recognize that learning something new will make you feel uncomfortable, displaced and even discouraged at times. But facing coding regularly, hopefully everday will create a mind shift if you are truly interested in web programming.</p>

            <p>Start looking for a job  and don't be discouraged by those long job skill requirements on the job ads.Search for freelance positions on LinkedIn, Dice, Craigslist, Power to Fly and network. Yes, you are a serious introvert but networking is doable and finding a position as the web developer can be your reality sooner than later.

            <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
            <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

            <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

            <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

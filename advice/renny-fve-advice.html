                <h2>Confusion is your friend!</h2>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, 
                    a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>
 
                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem 
                    solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h2>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h2>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest
                    framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but 
                    you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
 
                <p>You see, when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. 
                    The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing. Just like
                    with any other language immersion, dive in and just take it in as it comes. It may not make sense immediately, but eventually
                    it will all sink in.</p>

                <h2>To Add to the Above...</h2>
                <p>The advice above is very good. I feel that I likely have more to contribute, but I'm not sure what that is just yet. What I've
                    learned so far, though, is that it's important to really dive into the details. I personally have a tendency to rush through
                    the lessons instead of taking my time. I'm discovering that that is <em><stronger>not</stronger></em> going to help me. So
                    I think my contribution to the advice is to take it slow. Don't rush. Enjoy the process of learning. But don't stop, however
                    else you learn, whatever else you use to inspire you:

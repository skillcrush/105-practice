                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>Confusion means there is more to learn, so don't be afraid to hop onto slack and ask a question when you get stuck! Just reading the other student's questions can sometime teach you something new or answer your original question.</p>
                <h4>Break it up</h4>
                <p>Taking a break when you encounter a problem can make it much easier to solve. Sometimes it's a very basic solution and you just haven't thought of it because you've been staring at the screen for too long</p>
                <h4>Stop and Smell the Roses</h4>
                <p>Enjoy the rewarding feelings when you do solve a problem or create something new! The feeling you get from overcoming an obstacle during your courses builds momentum and confidence towards achieving your next goal.</p>
                <h4>Don't forget to make it fun</h4>
                <p>Treat the experience like cracking a code to a bank vault or learning to talk to robots. Your attitude about the learning experience can make all the difference in how quickly your progress in life. </p>
                <h4>Learn, Learn then Learn some more</h4>
                <p>Don't stop learning! If you're making the learning process fun, then there is no reason to stop. New technology has plenty of avenues to learn about, so try to keep your mind sharp and focused on learning a little something everyday. </p>
                <h4>Practice makes Perfect</h4>
                <p>Practice makes perfect - just like anything in life. If you're having trouble with a particular assignment, start over again or look for a similar assignment to test your skills on. It's only going to make you better with your new ninja tech skills.</p>

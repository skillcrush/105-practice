                <h4>Google is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Do what all programmers do and use Google...alot. Google is going to be your very best friend on this path.</p>
 
                <h4>Copying is NOT cheating.</h4>
                <p>If you find an awesome page and you want yours to look like it. View source and copy the code.  Every developer utilizes other's code and makes it their own. It's not cheating. There are awesome templates out there that provide a great starting point for your awesome page. Don't be afraid to use them.

                naturals,
                you may
                think you are the most stupid person in the universe, several times, and it will seam impossible, but
                it’s
                not!!! Yep, It’s
                good for a developer to have good logic, math and problem solving skills, but people are not born with
                those,
                even if
                they have a certain easiness with it, they still have to learn, they still have to practice, and if they
                can do
                it, YOU
                CAN TOO, all you need is patience, discipline and a lot of will.” </p>

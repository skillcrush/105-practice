                <h4>You can't be too thorough</h4>
                <p>When you start propgramming it's easy to overlook minor typos or proper orders of operations. It's easy to get carried away and want to work through the task at hand quickly, but doing so when you're still learning can cause some serious frustration when things don't work the way you expect them to.</p>
                <p>The best thing you can do is check your work early and often to ensure you use the right tags, that tags are closed, and that your code is clear and easy to comb through later if you need to.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="advice-two">
                <h4>Do your research</h4>
                <p>It's easy to get overwhemeled when there is so much to learn and you want to start working right away. However, its best to get a lay of the land early and lay a solid foundation so that you don't have to go back and try to learn something important when it's too late in the game.</p>
                <p>The internet is always changing and you can find so many resources to your questions online. So take the time to find the correct answer before getting too far ahead of yourself.</p>

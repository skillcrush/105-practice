                <h4>Don't Wait!</h4>
                <p>If you want to be a developer, go out and be a developer! Most people (including my former self) want to make sure they know everything
                    before they get started and as there is so much to learn that is setting you up to never taking action.
                </p>
                <p>I went out looking to pick up any kind of work related to development, any scraps web development companies don't have time for or
                    don't want to do. I managed to find myself a pretty decent gig doing simple content updates and security audits and updates on Joomla/Wordpress sites.
                    I would have never gotten this if I waited until I knew everything and was completely confident I would know what I was doing. For me true learning comes by doing
                    and taking that first step is a hige leap towards builds confidence in your abilities.
                </p>
                <p>Whenever you think of waiting a bit longer just remember, the things that come to those who wait may just be the things left by those who got there first! </p>

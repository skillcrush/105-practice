      <h2>If you're only doing it for the money, you shouldn't be doing it.</h2>
      <p>Come on. I shouldn't have to say this.</p>
      <h2>You can't be inspired and motivated every day.</h2>
      <p>
        And there's no shame in taking a break now and then. There are a few
        people that need to learn this. I can admit I'm one of them.

      <h2>Some people will outdo you.</h2>
      <p>
        But you can (and probably should!) learn from them.

      <h2>Find your own little thing to nerd out over and cherish it.</h2>

        I love programming ligatures. I love <a href="http://pugjs.org">Pug</a>,
        and <a href="http://gulpjs.com">Gulp</a>. Most of all, I love
        <a href="https://emmet.io/">Emmett snippets</a>. Find your own thing!

                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>Albert Camus said, “Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal.” When coding, I decided to expend no energy on being normal, that way I have more energy to learn to code. If I were you, I'd expend the most energy on experimenting when trying out new code. I'd expend no energy on worrying if others will like your work! ...well....until you actually need to think about ....well....clients.</p>
 
                <h4>Disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language or collaborating on GitHub, keep on believing that you didn't embarrass yourself and that you didnt actually add the Ranchers font to the headers. Use bright, garish colors to get people's attention. Fuhget about good UX design principles. Believe that you know what you're doing!</p>

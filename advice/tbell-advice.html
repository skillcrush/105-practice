                <h4>Remember Why You Started The Process</h4>
                <p>It’s not going to be easy and so there will be times when you think about changing your mind and
                  pursuing something you already know how to do.   But something made you want to try this.
                  So remember;</p>

                <p>- You have already learned so much.</p>
                <p>- So many others have succeeded, so there is no reason you can't too.</p>
                <p>- Your hard work will be rewarded.</p>

                <h4>Focus on the Next Step, But also think about the Big Picture.</h4>
                <p>When coding be sure to pay attention to detail, but always remember what the end result should be.
                  What is the goal of the project?  This will help you add input towards that goal as you work.</p>

                <p>Stick with it and immerse yourself in it by studying the cheat sheets, looking at the coding on some
                  of your favority websites, and practicing.  When you get stuck, solve that one individual problem, and
                  don't worry about what's next.</p>

                <h4>It's okay to just not know the answer!</h4>
                <p>You could stare at the screen for 100 years and still not find the answer you're looking for. That is perfectly normal. None of us are born knowing how to code like a pro. It's not a weakness or something to feel ashamed about. There's so much help to utilize both in person and on the internet.</p>

                <h4>When in doubt: use Google.</h4>
                <p>I'll be the first to say it-- Google comes in <strong>clutch</strong>. You're never truly alone when it comes to any problems you have. There is not only someone who's had the same issue but a whole page dedicated to solving that problem. I honestly belive Google is the best friend of anyone who codes.</p>
                <p>Never be afraid to utilize it!</p>

                <h4>Accept frustration</h4>
                <p>Coding is like learning a new language where even the words in English don't seem to make much sense. The frustration can be hard to accept, but I've come to see it as a big part of the day to day experience.
                The frustration that pops up over and over when you're learning to code ultimately plays second fiddle to the feeling of triumph when you finally figure out the solution to your problem! It's like scratching that one persistent itch in the hardest to reach spot.
                After a while, this cycle of frustration and relief becomes second nature and even a little bit addictive. Or maybe I'm just weird!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="habit">
              <h4>Make it a habit</h4>
              <p>Habit is a daily practice, but like all practice it should be forgiving in order to be effective. Try your best to stick to whatever schedule you lay out, but don't beat yourself up if you fall behind or life gets in the way a little. Ultimately what matters most is the ability to pick up wherever you leave off and enthusiastically continue forward.</p>

                <h3>Consistency is key.</h3>
                <p>When you start learning to code (or start any new endeavor), you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a brand new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific and detailed that many people will not see it through. If you can practice on a regular basis, you will increase your familiarity with the material, and in turn, increase your chances for success.</p>
 
                <h3>Learn the fundamentals.</h3>
                <p>Mastery of any subject involves learning the core concepts behind what you are doing. Technologies come and go, but the fundamental principles remain the same, and they influence all of these new technologies. Take the time to learn the fundamentals, and master them. A solid foundation will give you the advantage when it comes to learning new languages, frameworks, and other programming skills.</p>
 
                <h3>Slow is the path to fast.</h3>
                <p>Do not allow yourself to rush through the material. It's easy to get impatient and feel pressure to rush through the material, especially if you are in between jobs. Take the time to digest the concepts, understand the code you are writing, and why. You'll thank yourself later for it. Slow and steady wins the race.</p>

                <h3>Focus on one thing at a time.</h3>
                <p>It's easy to get overwhelmed by the sheer volume of information that is presented to aspiring software developers. Pick ONE thing, and see it through to completion. Then pick another thing, and complete it. Rinse, repeat. If you can do this, in a relatively short period of time, you will have the skills that employers are looking for, and you will have more confidence when it comes to programming.</p>

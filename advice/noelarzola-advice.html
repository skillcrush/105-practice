                    <h2>If you have written one single line of code, then you are a real programmer - and if you keep on coding and learning, you will one day be a master, too.</h2>

                    <p>Folks, this is so true and you better believe it. This is a quote I came across during the end of a course in the second tour of my learning to program journey. I gotta tell you, I wish they had introduced this quote to us after one of the first few classes. If you are reading this, chances are very good that you have written a line of code. Don't let imposter syndrome kick in, you ARE a real programmer. You belong here, and you CAN do this.</p>

                    <h2>Be Water, My Friend.<br>
                        Empty your mind. <br>
                        Be formless, shapeless, like water. <br>
                        You put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. <br>
                        You put water into a bottle, it becomes the bottle. <br>
                        You put it into a teapot, it becomes the teapot. <br>
                        Now water can flow or it can crash. <br>
                        Be water, my friend.</h2>

                    <p>When coding in HTML and CSS you'll likely get stuck (if you haven't already) piddling with math trying to get floats and paddings and the like just right.....or even close to right lol! Be water, you got this. This quote is especially true for languages such as JavaScript when you'll spend a lot of time forgetting code, debugging, searching for answers, and asking a lot of questions! Stay fluid and adapt to each situation. You'll never be stuck on something forever, and even "pros" and "masters" will Google the simplest things. You can't (and don't have to) memorize everything!</p>

      <h2><i>Confusion is your friend!</i></h2>
    <p><i>When you start learning your first programming language you are doing something that you have never done before. You may feel overwhelmed at times. And it is ok to feel that way. This is a new challenge that will turn into an even bigger opportunity. And the information that's available is endless. But try not to think about the cavernous terrain of programming languages, libraries, frameworks, etc.  Instead, try targeting on what you need to learn for your career specialty. Think about just one language that you need and start with that. And when you feel comfortable enough, move on to another language. The secret to learning this information is not by setting one big goal, but by dividing it into much more attainable and smaller ones.</i></p>

    <h2>No, you cannot throw your laptop away.</h2>
    <p>Here is the industry disclaimer: you WILL find yourself just staring at your computer screen sometimes.   You may ask yourself, "Why isn't this working?" You start an endless cycle of writing code, testing         code, and get frustrated at the code when it
      doesn't work. You will blink alot. The time will fly by. And then you'll get soo frustrated that you just want to pick up your laptop and chunk it as far away from you as you can. But don't do it. Instead, I offer this suggestion...Go watch some
      tv.</p>

    <p>I know it sounds simple. But it works. Watching tv totally shuts down that problem-solving side of your   brain and lets it rest. Better yet, go watch some reality tv; something of no intellectual value           what-soever. After a few laughs, headshakes, and
      shoulder shrugs, you will be able to come back and look at the code with fresh eyes and I bet you will solve the problem in no time.</p>

    <h2>What "type" of people?</h2>
    <p>It's perfectly normal to question why in the world you are doing this. Especially if this is a career     change for you. You may think that you're not quick enough, or smart enough, or even young enough. You,     my friend, have bought into the myth that
      web developers are a certain "type" of people. And you are not even close to being one of those "types" of peple. But let me let you in on a little secret: there's no such thing as a type. That was an old recruiting tool that someone thought up
      30+ years ago. It's antiquated and out-of-date. The truth of the matter is that you are a unique and creative person with something to offer to this industry. You are very much needed. And the industry is lucky to have you.</p>

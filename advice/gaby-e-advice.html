                <h4>Don't give up!</h4>
                <p>When you start learning how to code, you will question if you did the right decision. You won't understand the terms or the assigments you are doing.</p>

                <p>This feeling is normal. Relax and breathe but never quit! After you push through the whole course, suddendently a light bulb will turn on.</p>
                <h4>Trust the process.</h4>
                <p>It goes hand in hand with what I mentioned in the paragraph above. Do everything on your part that is required. Do your lessons every week.
                <p>If you fill stuck, reach out to the Skillcrush community. You have many resources. Be sure to use them.</p>

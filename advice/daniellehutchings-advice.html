               <h4>Don't give up!</h4>
               <p>When learning to code you may find yourself stuck on a challenge or a new topic you are learning. Know that this is ok, and happens to everyone. If it was easy everyone would easily learn how to do it. When faced with these situations, try taking a break and revisiting the problem.</p>

               <p>This is something that helps me to solve any problem I get stuck on. The feeling of being able to solve a problem is worth any confusion endured. Perserverance is a skill you will need.</p>

               <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
               <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

               <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

               <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

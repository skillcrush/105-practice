    <h2>Keep your eyes on the prize!</h2>
      <p>When you get discouraged, distracted, or frustrated, remember why you are doing this, and let that motivate you.</p>
    <h2>You're not an imposter.</h2>
      <p>If you are doubting your abilities and feeling like you don't belong, switch it up on that negative self-doubt, and doubt that doubt!</p>
    <h2>Ask for help.</h2>
      <p>There is no shame in asking for help, and help is sometimes the most efficient way to get something done.</p>

        <h1>Hi, my name is Lizz and I have some advice!</h1>
    </header>

        <div class="advice">
            <h4>Ask for help</h4>
            <p>I made the mistake of not asking for help when I started, even though I live with an amazing developer!
            </p>
            <p>We aren't coding in a vaccum, no one starts out a super star, and everyone has been where you are now.
                Finding community and asking for help when you need it can save you lots of time.
            </p>

            <p>It's impossible to know everything there is to know about code. You will be challenged every day. The
                best developers are really *really* good at asking questions - and the tech community is extremely
                supportive.</p>

            <h4>Celebrate your success</h4>
            <p>Coding is hard, and staying motivated can be even harder. Finding ways to celebrate your little victories
                can help keep your spirits up when you are facing down with wicked problems.

                <p>Remember to think about how far you've come! Think of how many things you can understand that used to
                    seem like jibberish! You're a total badass, and you've got this!</p>


                <h4>Take breaks</h4>
                <p>Don't get sucked into problems so deeply that you forget to take care of yourself. It's easy to loose
                    track of time when you are staring at a computer, your brain in a pretzel. Step away, and come back
                    to your problems refreshed.</p>
                <p>The best solutions can sometimes come when you're away from the computer, and your mind is on
                    something totally different. Give your subconscious mind a little space to proces. A change in
                    perspective can lead to unexpected solutions.</p>

                <h4>Practice, and practive More</h4>
                <p>Yep! You're just going to have to code, code, code ... and then code some more. This is a totally
                    different way of thinking and solving problems. Repeated practice will help your brain to form new
                    synaptic connections, that will strengthen over time, and eventually become part of your longterm
                    memory. </p>

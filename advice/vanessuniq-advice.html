            <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
            <p>Expect to be confused, because you will be, no doubt! You are learning new languages, so it's normal. It is not something you've done before.</p>

            <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity
                awaits.
            </p>

            <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
            <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this
                THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

            <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

            <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
            <p>Best believe everything gets better with practice, and you will be amazed by how much you learn everyday. Do not get discouraged, instead have fun!</p>

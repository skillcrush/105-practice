            <h4>Don't be afraid to make mistakes.</h4>
            <p>Learning something new is challenging but can also be rewarding. You will not master everything right away, and that's a good thing. Mistakes are often our best teachers and will reinforce important concepts, so don't fear them!</p>

            <h4>Frustration is normal; take a break to avoid feeling overwhelmed.</h4>
            <p>When you are learning a new technology, the amount of new information coming at you can be overwhelming. Getting stuck on any step in a new process can cause a lot of frustration. It's ok to take a break when this feeling sets in and return to a problem later with a fresh set of eyes.</p>

          <div class="advice">
            <h4>Believe in yourself, no matter what.</h4>
            <p>Confidence in taking a new path may not be there every day, but keep moving forward. Difficult coding concepts will get easier with practice and time. <br> You are worth the effort, and it will pay off - keep it up!</p>

        <h4>Take the leap, it will be worth it!</h4>
          <p>My very best advice to you as a newbie is to
          stop googling three more weeks
          &quot;in case you haven't seen ALL the options yet&quot;,
          make a decision and LETs GO!
          You will never feel ready but every day you wait is a day you could
          have been making progress towards reaching your goals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="advice2">
        <h4>Yes, YOU can do it, too!</h4>
          <p>I just finished my Master's in History so not a tech related field AT ALL.
            In school I was terrible at maths, or any sciences for that matter.
            Yet here I am, I already finished the HTML and CSS course, and I can follow
            all the lessons. Even though I'm not good at maths or have a scientist's brain.
            The truth is: You have no idea of all the things you can do until you do them.</p>

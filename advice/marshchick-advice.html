            <h4>Go with your Gut!</h4>
            <p> When you start something new you can be bombarded with so much information.  Often you feel as if your head is spinning.
            Don't panic! Take it slowly and yive yourself time to process all the new information. Once you've spent a good amount of time practicing it will become second
            nature.  If you get stuck, take a deep breath and go with your gut!  Trust yourself.</p>
           <h4>Don't give up!</h4>
           <p>No matter how frustrated you get in your new endeavor, remember that you are doing something that you like.  Patience is your friend. If you keep at it you will figure it out.</p>

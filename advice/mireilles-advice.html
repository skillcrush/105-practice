                <h2>Be The Tortoise</h2>

                <p>You know that old Aesop Tale about the tortoise and the hare? We all know the
                  tortoise won, slow and steady does it. No need for adderall here. You're not really
                  in a competition with anyone else. Gaining new skills is simply about self-development
                  and that is, if anything, a case where your only real competition is yourself. That
                  sounds very sci-fi, doesn't it?</p>

                <h2>Typos and misspellings</h2>

                <p>Most of the time, when you have a problem, a mistake - it's something simple: a typo,
                   a spelling error, not closing a tag. Look for the simple problems (and simple solutions)
                   first.</p>

                <h2>Practice, practice, practice</h2>

                <p>As with anything in life, the way you get good at coding is: practice, practice, practice.
                  It doesn't have to be a huge piece of coding every day. If all you've got is 15 minutes,
                  then that's still 15 minutes of coding, of practice, and you are a little further ahead.
                  Everything our grade-school teachers told us about cramming was true. It's a little
                  bit every day that's going to get you where you want to go.</p>

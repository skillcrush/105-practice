            <h1>Hi! My name is Rachael and I have some advice for you.</h1>

            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Ignore the haters (yes, that includes you).</h4>
                <p>You may have people in your life who don't believe you're cut out to be a coder or web designer. <em>You</em> may be the person in your life giving side-eye in the mirror, ticking through a list of all the reasons you're not up to the task of learning a complicated and entirely new skill set.

                <p>Don't listen to that nonsense.</p>

                <p>Babies aren't up to speaking in full sentences; toddlers can't ride a bike or read a chapter book or tie their own shoes; elementary school kids can't drive a car or vote in municipal elections. Does any of that make them failures? Of course not. Will they get there eventually? Absolutely, if they keep moving forward. And you, who are not a baby or toddler or grade school kid, have an entire life's history of learning new skills &mdash; even very difficult ones.</p>

                <p>Don't listen to the haters: You've got this.</p>

                <h4>Proofread and validate...</h4>

                <p>I'm new enough in my education that I don't have any crazy stories yet about the pitfalls of failing to double check my code; I just haven't written enough. I'm sure it's only a matter of time. I do have a story from a long-ago creative writing class, though, when a friend failed to proofread thoroughly:</p>

                <p>Somehow, the phrase "gentle touch" became "genital touch." Even spellcheck couldn't save him, and just like that he was writing in a whole other genre!</p>

                <p>Attention to detail is <em>so</em> important.</p>

                <h4>...But don't stress the mistakes.</h4>

                <p>My husband tackles home improvement projects with his tool chest, blood pressure medication, and a long list of swear words. He's handy enough to be dangerous but by no means an expert, and every miscalculation makes him furious. I'm even less handy than he is, but I just accept that for any DIY project I begin, I'll mess up at least once (and probably more) before I get it right. Because I don't expect perfection, I don't get irritated or angry with myself when I do things wrong.</p>

                <p>Of course we all want to do things correctly more often than not, but mistakes are inevitable. They can be frustrating or they can be funny, but either way, navigating your mistakes with patience is the best way to learn.</p>

                <p>Babies don't learn to walk without falling <em>a lot</em>, and you and I won't become expert coders or web designers without screwing things up over and over. Don't get mad, and don't give up. Think of your mistakes as an opportunity to understand the process more deeply.</p>


                <h4>Sit up straight!</h4>
                <p>Unless you're a ballet dancer, served in the military, or spent your adolescence walking around with a book on your head, perfecting your graceful gait, you probably need this advice. Most of us, especially those of us who spend a lot of time on computers, could stand to work on our posture! Consider this your daily reminder:</p>

                <h5>STRAIGHTEN UP!</h5>

                <p>Maintaining good posture can strengthen your back and help to ease back pain. I didn't realize before Googling, but there are a lot of <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/fitness-exercise/posture-benefits" target="_blank">other, less obvious benefits</a> to straightening up, including fewer headaches, improved digestion, increased energy levels, and greater lung capacity. Who knew? (Maybe you did. This was news to me.)</p>

                <p>So. Imagine a string tied to your spine and extending through the top of your head, then imagine gently pulling that string straight up. Feel yourself slumping after a while? Just give it another tug.</p>

                <p>Your whole body will thank you!</p>

        <h4>Embrace the Challenge.</h4>
              <p>If you’re like me, you signed up for Skillcrush courses because you were unfulfilled in your current career.  This was a brave first step, which means you already possess the determination and tenacity to achieve your ultimate goal: to find a job in tech that you love! Learning something new is challenging, but overcoming these challenges by working hard and not quitting will lead you to success.</p>
              <p>Learning to code is like learning a foreign language.  You have to accept that sometime you may not understand something the first time and will have to use your amazing problem solving skills to in order to gain deeper clarity into what you’re learning.  Lucky for you, the internet and Skillcrush community are there to help when you have questions or need help to complete a task.</p>
        <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
              <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this <strong>THING</strong> but you don't understand <strong>HOW</strong> exactly it's happening.</p>
              <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
              <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

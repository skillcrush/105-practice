            <h1><span>Hi</span>, my name is Aaron</h1>
            <h2>and I have some advice for you!</h2>

                <h4>Be true to <span>yourself</span>.</h4>
                <p>I say, go for it!</p>

                <p>The thing is: this is the first day of the rest of your life!</p>

                <h4>Stay in <span>the game</span>.</h4>
                <p>It's all about drinking less and less and doing more and more!</p>

                <p>God don't make no shit! So take that into consideration.</p>

                <p>Don't "should" on your shoulders. The tortoise eats the hare every time. Small, consistent wins every day are better than huge wins for a few days followed by burnout.</p>

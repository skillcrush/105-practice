                <p>When you are learning a new skill, being able to deeply concentrate on the task at hand will allow you to learn more quickly.</p>
                    <p>You may find your brain becoming tired as it is asked to do many new things.  Instead of switching to checking email or your 
                        social media when you feel mental fatigue set in try getting up for a short walk outside or make a cup of tea or coffee.  
                        This allows your brain to continue mulling over the new information and stay within the new task while taking a gentle break</p>

                <h4>Building up the ability to <span style="color: #A1A1A1">focus</span> yields dividends</h4>
                <div class="Building-focus">  
                <p>When you are starting to learn something new, it can be tiring.  Instead of trying to be busy all day learning a new skill,  try to spend the time of day when you feel freshest doing the most challenging work. </p>
                    <p>By prioritizing the new skill or project you are currently working on for when you feel freshest you can get your best work done.</p>
                    <p>Other less useful projects like catching up on email can be left to later in the day after your most important tasks are complete</p>

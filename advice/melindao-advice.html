				<h4>Listen to your heart</h4>
                <p>Be true to who you are, who you want to be and and if you want to change the course in you career that is up to you and only <span>you</span>, don't let others try and make that decision for you.</p>
                
				<h4>Confusion is part of the process!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming you will be working with new challenges doing something that is new and different to you.  You will be starting unique and new opportunities to build and learn software development. </p>
 
                <p>As you step through the doors and begin your adventure in world of coding you will find that there are times you will be excited about what you are doing and learn, and others where you will be pulling out your hair and trying not to cry. The confusion and frustration is part of the learning process, but makes the successes that much sweeter.</p>
				
				<p>This life choice change you are making for yourself, and it is okay if you questions yourself, but remember you are on the right path.</p>
				
 
                <h4>Stay in <span>action</span>.</h4>
                <p>Learning to code for 5 minutes a day for a year will get you farther than thinking about learning to code for an hour every day, but never doing it.</p>
 
                <p>Action is what takes hopes and dreams and turns them into reality.</p>
 
                <p>Don't "should" on your self. The tortoise beats the hare every time. Small, consistent wins every day are better than huge wins for a few days followed by burnout.</p>

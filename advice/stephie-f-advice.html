                <h4>It's pretty simple stuff...</h4>
                    <p>Just start.<br>
                    Don't be afraid to make mistakes.<br>
                    Commit to <strong>at least</strong> one hour a day. Put it in your schedule if that helps!<br>
                    If a whole hour seems like a lot, take a 5-10 minute break after 30 minutes.<br>
                    If it ever seems too hard, remember that even your instructors had to learn all of this too.<br>
                    Reach out to other students when you need help or want support.<br>
                    Keep going.</p>

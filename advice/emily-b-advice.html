                    <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                    <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>
                    <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                    <h4>Embrace your mistakes.</h4>
                    <p>It's inevitable that you will lose track of the directions, hit the wrong key, or forget to add some small piece of punctuation in your code.</p>
                    <p>You may feel like shutting the program and closing your computer. But, rather than getting frustrated, look at it as an opportunity.</p>
                    <p>There are countless resources on the internet that will help you get out of your pickle. Google it, and fix it yourself! It's a great way to learn, and to remember not to make the same mistake again.</p>

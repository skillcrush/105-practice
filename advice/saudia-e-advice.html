                <h4>Remember: Google is your friend</h4>
                <p>And no it is not cheating! Google has been and hopefully will always be one of the most reliable resources that we have as we are trying
                    to navigate our way through the dark waters of web development. 
                </p>
                <p>Some things you encounter along your web developing journey just won't make sense and that is normal. Remember the last time you learned something new?
                    It more than likely did not come out great the first or second time that you tried, but after some determination, many failures, and probably countless
                    Google inquiries, I bet you perfected it and your skills are AWESOME now. Well, this is similar. You learn nothing if you don't fail and you don't succeed if you don't try.
                </p>

                <h4>Push yourself past your limits of open-mindedness...and patience</h4>
                <p>I have always known that I can be so focused on what the outcome will be that I miss the journey. Learning web development
                    has tested the way that I process ideas because I find myself breaking down websites and figuring out their layouts, having to think it out rather than just get to my goal. Never in a million years would
                    I have ever imagined that I would be able to do that. Yet, here I am.
                </p>
                <p>Being patient also comes into play. You wouldn't believe how many hours (no, seriously, HOURS) I have spent trying to make one exercise
                    look exactly like it should and wondering what I did wrong. But, man, all of that time up-front for practice only makes my future
                    projects go that much quicker.
                </p>
                <p>I say all of this to say: anything that is worth having takes time, patience, and belief in yourself.</p>

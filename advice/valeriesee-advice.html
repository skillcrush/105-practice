            <h4>Practice. Practice. Practice.</h4>
            <p>The absolute most important thing I could reccommend to 
                be successful in this course is to immediately apply
                whatever is covered to a practical project. I know that
                there are plenty of opportunities to do so within the course,
                but to ensure you remember the process it helps a ton to 
                practice on your own.
            </p>

            <div id="section2">
            <h4>Read and Research</h4>
            <p>There are external resources provided in the course,but 
                there is a whole internet out there full of resources 
                waiting for you to dive into! Learning the same material
                from different perspectives provides a greater understanding
                and may offer a learning style that is better suited to
                your needs.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="section3">
            <h4>Be Persistant.</h4>
            <p>Unfortunately not every bit of code you write is going to be perfect
                on the first go. Be patient with yourself and do not give up. 
                If you need to step away from a frustrating portion of the class, go put on some tea, clear your
                head and get right back at it.

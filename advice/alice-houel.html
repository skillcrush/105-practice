            <h4 class="advice-title">Never Give Up!</h4>
            <p class="advice-text">Learning new technology or concepts can be overwhelming at times and it can be tempting to give up,
                thinking we'll never get it. But I assure you, you got this! Just keep at it and you will get it, it
                will click!</p>

        <div class="advice">
            <h4 class="advice-title">Repetition and practice are key</h4>
            <p class="advice-text">The best way to learn and integrate new concepts and technology is to practice, practice, practice... and practice some more! I also
                watch, listen, read several tutorials about the same thing as I find repetition to work for me and also
                because people have different ways of explaining a same concept and some might be more successful, make more sense to me than
                others.</p>

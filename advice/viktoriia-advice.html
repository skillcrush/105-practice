                <div class="advice-one">
                        <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                        <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that 
                            you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in 
                            the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably 
                            never been done before. Don't give up! 
                            Confusion is a sign you are on the right track!</p>
                            <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. 
                                It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology 
                                and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="advice-two">
                        <h4>Don't forget to eat and exercise!</h4>
                        <p>Remember to eat healthy and to exercise. Our body is our fortress.
                            If you don't take proper care of your health, you won't able to
                            concentrate, innovate, and simply work normally. 
                            Remember that your body is your best friend on your way to the new and 
                            exciting world of tech, so treat it well!

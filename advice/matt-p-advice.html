                <h4>Focus on the fundamentals</h4>
                <p>Learning to code can be a daunting endeavor. The world of software development is wide and expansive, with so much to learn as to be daunting. But keep in mind that in order to master any skill, you must first spend considerable time on the smallest, most fundamental building blocks first.</p>
                <p>The tempation to breeze through the foundational elements of a programming or markup language and quickly move on to a popular framework like React or Rails or Angular is strong. Resist that tempation. Instead, focus on the base elements of the langage, the things that don't change, until you've reached a strong degree of proficiency. Only then, move forward and add to the fundamentals.</p>
 
                <h4>Pursue proficiency, not just Awareness</h4>
                <p>Awareness is simply adding a bullet point to your conceptual internal database. You can gain it by watching a tutorial or working through a handful of exercies.</p>
                <p>Proficiency is truly becoming skilled at implementing the new knowledge you're looking to learn. You can actually apply this new skill to real-world problems and understand the usefulness and limitations of the topic.</p>
                <p>When learning to code, strive for proficiency. Spending your time on simply attaining awareness is often counterproductive to achieving your goals.</p>

                <h4>Take you time</h4>
                <p>Programming is a complex skill to learn but it is also a highly attainable goal, as long as you're willing to put in the time. Applying an artificial time limit or deadline to learn a topic (2 weeks, a month, 3 months, etc.) is almost always unhelpful.</p>
                <p>Remove those mental time limits and take it slow. That's not to say to only spend a few minutes a day on studying. Spend as much time as is feasable in your schedule. But study those low-level, fundamental elements relentlessly, without the pressue to move on to the next thing before you're ready. Accept that the path to mastery is a slow one. Slow, but rewarding.</p>

                <h4>Read Mastery</h4>
                <p>Read George Leonard's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mastery-Keys-Success-Long-Term-Fulfillment/dp/0452267560">Mastery</a> or something similar to get yourself excited about the prospects of pursuing mastery in any number of endeavors, including sofware development. Before embarking on a journey to learn something to the level of acquiring proficiency, set the table for your mind and begin developing those mental and physical strategies that give you the best chance of success.</p>

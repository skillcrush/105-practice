                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It is uncharted territory, a new opportunity. And in the case of software development, it is so specific there is a possibility it may not have been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process. Trust the process. Believe in yourself. You will learn and you will understand. Remember, you are brave and just keep going. You will look back to see how far you have come and how much you have learned. Then you will smile and feel pride in yourself.</p>

        <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
        <p>
          The most important step to all endeavours is the first step! If you
          have made it this far, then congratulations on beginning your journey.
          It will be a long, potentially frustrating, road ahead but so
          fulfilling.
        </p>

        <p>
          Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right
          direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving
          pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig
          deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.
        </p>

        <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
        <p>
          When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to
          write your first programming language, or just the latest framework,
          you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code
          you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW
          exactly it's happening.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and
          in fact, it's a critical part of the process.
        </p>

        <p>
          You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your
          learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train
          your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally
          understand what it's doing.

                <h2>1. Keep Going</h2>
                <p>I literally have those words tattooed on my arm (which, in retrospect, was not necessary, but we've all been young, right?)! Nevertheless, their truth is sound. Remember to keep going, even when you feel least capable of continuing. This is a learning process, which means that every time you take the next step, you're reminding yourself that there is more to learn and that you are <em>ready</em> and <em>willing</em> to participate in this important process of growth.</p>
                <p>The fact is: you only fail when you quit! Even if something is confusing or tricky or takes you a few tries, continuing to work at it <strong>will</strong> produce positive outcomes! How could it not? ;) So keep going and keep on growing!</p>
                <h2>2. Prioritize Your Goals</h2>
                <p>This is another important tip. As parents, or partners, or workers, or caregivers, or [enter your personal responsibility here], we can easily lose track of why <strong>we</strong> chose to embark on this journey. With so many outside distractions that seem more important at the moment, it's easy to put learning aside and prolong our own success even further.</p>
                <p>The important thing to remember here is that <strong>your success is very important</strong>. If it doesn't seem to be as important to others, that's ok. It only needs to be important enough to you that you keep showing up for yourself. Change is hard, and others can't see the effects of this change right away. They may not share your vision, or understand your motives, or they want to be supportive and simply don't know how.</p>
                <p>Take the reigns and <strong>prioritize your goals</strong> over the usual ins and outs of the day. That is how you will make consistent progress and succeed. And the fruits of your labor will be plenty for all your loved ones to share! A tree isn't grown overnight, and your success will not be instantaneous either. However, if you keep at it, it will absolutely be <strong>worth it</strong> for you and everyone you include in your life.</p>
                <h2>3. Share Your Successes</h2>
                <p>It's easy to confine ourselves to our own opinions when there's no one else giving us feedback. And when you're new to something, your own opinions may not be the most reliable perspective (especially if you're prone to critical self-talk, like me). That's why it's <strong>super important</strong> to share your successes with others. If you're in a physical class environment, that's much easier to do, but when you're studying something online or from home, it can be more challenging to reach out to others.</p>
                <p>Thankfully, we live in the tech age, and there are online social platforms galore. Join a relevant Facebook group, find a local MeetUp, hop on a Slack thread, and of course, with Skillcrush, the community is built right in! Be sure to check in to the community regularly: for me, that means multiple times a day. Even if you don't share something every time, seeing others' progress, struggles and wins will motivate you to keep going. Your peers can also be there to support you when the going gets tough because they know what it's like to be in your shoes.</p>
                <p>Allow others to support and encourage you, which is what sharing your success is all about. Take feedback with a kind smile and again, <strong>keep going!</strong></p>

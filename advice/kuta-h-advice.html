                    <h3>Confusion is your friend!</h3>
                      <p>Learning how to code for the first time is not easy. It is definately like learning a new language. You are bound to get confused because it doesn't make any sense at first.</p>
                      <p>It can be overwhelming at times, but I can tell you from experience, that if you push through those hard "gluts", those times where you just want to stop, go to your kitchen and get your 10th snack, go back and push through those hard parts. You will come out on the other side more knoweledgable and be so proud of yourself for seeing it through!</p>
                      <p> Practice.....practice.....practice. There's no denying, you WILL get better, the more you practice!</p>

                    <h3>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h3>
                      <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
                      <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
                      <p>Part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

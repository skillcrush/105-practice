                <h4>Words from a n00b</h4>
                <p>I'm happy to hear from others that you learn as you do and you aren't expected to know exactly how everything works right away.
                    <br><br>I will say what has helped me is committing daily time to skillcrushing. Even though I'm tired at the end of the day and another hour of focusing sounds exhausting, I always
                    get my energy back knowing I'm advancing my learning and my knowledge in this space. One hour a day seems long at first, but it flies by and is always worth it: <em>even if Hulu and Netflix are calling my name.</em></p>

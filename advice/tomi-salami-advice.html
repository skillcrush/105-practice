        <h4>Mistakes are your friend!</h4>
        <p>
          When you start coding it's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in
          the case of software development, something so specific that it's
          probably never been done before. Mistakes are part of the process and
          should be looked at as an opportunity to improve your skills!
        </p>

        <h4>Have some faith and trust the learning process</h4>
        <p>
          When you are learning a new technology or process, you go through this
          uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is
          doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and
          in fact, it's a critical part of the process.
        </p>

        <p>
          You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your
          learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train
          your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally
          understand what it's doing.

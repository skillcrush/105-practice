                <h4>Don't be discouraged if you don't get something on the first try!</h4>
                <p>Learning any new skill takes time. Be patient with yourself as you're learning.</p>

                <p>Take PLENTY of notes. Yes, the provided cheatsheets are great but writing things out on your own helps with retention.</p>


                <h4>Get more practice after you complete your Skillcrush projects.</h4>
                <p>Practice will help you continue to build and perfect your skills and you will also have more content to add to your portfolio.</p>

                <p>Use this extra practice as a time to experiment and see what else you can do with your html &amp; css.</p>

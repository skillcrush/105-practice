            <h1>Hi my name is Shannon and I have some great advice. The BEST advice. GREAT advice. There's so many adjectives I could use to describe it. SO GOOD!</h1>

            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Derek, I hope you are reading this because it's likely no one else will! See below for advice from Beta and Trout</h4>
                <p>Beta's advice is "feed me early and often." Kinda like how often you should backup your changes on git!</p>

                <p>Trout's advice is "fill Burt early and often."</p>
                <p>Are you seeing a trend here??</p>

                <h4>I am out of any meaningful advice, so the template language exists below. Creativity fail.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

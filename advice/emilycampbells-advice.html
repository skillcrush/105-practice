                <h4>Get out of your house!</h4>
                <p>Taking an online class can feel isolating at times.  I try to go to a coffee shop when I can to be in a different environment and not get distracted by chores I have to get done at home.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="advice-two">
                <h4>Failure leads to learning!</h4>
                <p>The more you fail, the more you can learn from your mistakes. Sometimes the concepts I know the best, took me the longest to figure out.  Once you do though, it will stick in your brain forever!</p>

                    <h4>Your willpower has limits!</h4>

                    <p>
                        Like any of your capacities, your willpower has limits.
                        Don't think that you can spend 20 hours a day working on
                        your goals. Your first priority should be to not give up. If
                        you can make sure that you actually are working on
                        it, and that you aren't neglecting yourself, then work on
                        doing more.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="half-width">
                    <h4>Don't give up!</h4>

                    <p>
                        In order to make sure that you are actually working enough
                        on it, give yourself goals that you can actually accomplish,
                        and reward yourself for completing them. You need to be
                        honest with yourself and not make excuses to yourself. Learn
                        to spot and dispute your own bull$#*%!
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="half-width" id="second-line">
                    <h4>Be nice to yourself!</h4>

                    <p>
                        This one is probably a bit more specific to me. Keep a
                        checklist of things you need to do for your own morale, and
                        do those things. Have you eaten today? How much sleep did
                        you get? Shower? Meds? Bills? Homework? Cleaned? Have you
                        found time to relax for a minute? Have you said something
                        nice about yourself today? Have you worked on your mental
                        health today? Try to remember that this isn't going to
                        change overnight and you need to work on it like everything
                        else.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="half-width">
                    <h4>Make things easy!</h4>

                    <p>
                        The point of code and mathematics is to make your life
                        easier. Don't just code for other people's benefit. Code
                        tools to make your own life easier. Customize some
                        boilerplate for your projects, make macros for your text
                        editor, make assets for yourself. Work for you too.

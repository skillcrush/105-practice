                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app, you are doing something you've never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific it has probably never been done before.</p>
 
                <p>Confusion is a sign you're heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you are engaged in the problem-solving pursuit that is math and technology. It's the trigger to dig deeper because clarity awaits.</p>
 
                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you're learning a new technology, whether it's your first programming language or the latest framework, you must persist through that uncomfortable phase of knowing the code you're looking at is doing this THING and you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology -- a crucial part.</p>
 
                <p>You see, when you're learning a new language, training your eye is a big part of the process. Reading code trains your eye even when you don't understand what it's doing.</p>

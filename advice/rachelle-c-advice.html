                <h4>Just Keep Swimming</h4>
                <p>If you've seen the beloved children's movie <em>Finding Nemo</em>, you're familiar with his father Marlin's scatterbrained sidekick's mantra, <strong>"Just Keep Swimming</strong>." It's this advice that helps Marlin reach his goal of finding his son. This mantra has been a favorite of my family's since we saw the movie. No matter the sharks that try to eat you, the currents that try to push you off course, or a maze of jellyfish you have to navigate, <strong>if you keep swimming, there will always be guides along the way to help you reach your goal</strong>.</p>

                <h4>If at first you don't fricasee, fry, fry a hen <!--<br><span class="smaller">(i.e. Don't give up, Failure is your friend)</span>--></h4>
                <p>This phrase, obviously a take on "If at first you don't succeed..." made up by a quirky teenager in one of my favorite books, <em>Laddie</em>, is also a favorite mantra at our house.  A few years ago, a friend of mine was teaching me to make flan, a delectable Latin American dessert. It was like second nature to him, so he tried to write the recipe down for me. I attempted it several times and it never turned out the way it was supposed to. Each time, I dumped it and started over. Finally I called him over to help. He laughed and said, "Don't throw that away! You've made ..." (I forget what he called it). So, as I learned from <em>Laddie</em> and from my friend, <strong>when you try something new and it doesn't turn out like it's supposed to, keep trying, learn from it, and see if there's something else you can use it for!</strong> </p>

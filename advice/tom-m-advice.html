                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing 
                    something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge,
                     a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, 
                     something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>
 
                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right 
                    direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving 
                    pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig 
                    deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
 
                <h4>Self-education Helps Some</h4>
                <p>Before I became a student of Skillcrush, I struck out on my own to learn
                    as much a possible about web programming/coding for free. While there are
                    excellent resources such as <a href="http://www.theodinproject.com">The 
                    Odin Project</a> or <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.org">Free Code Camp</a>,
                    there is some direction and structure with these, the amount of time spent 
                    reading with these resources is much higher than what you will experience 
                    through Skillcrush.
                </p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write 
                    your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go 
                    through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are 
                    looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's 
                    happening.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in 
                    fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
 
                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning 
                    process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is 
                    to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what 
                    it's doing.</p>

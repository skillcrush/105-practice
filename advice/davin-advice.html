                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before.<br>
                   It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development,<br>
                    something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction.<br>
                   It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology<br>
                    and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language,<br>
                   or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are<br>
                    looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye.<br>
                   The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

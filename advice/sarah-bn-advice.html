                <h4>GOOGLE IT</h4>
                <p>Seriously. Google it. Stuck? Google it! Syntax not coming to you. GOOGLE IT. You're jumping into a new language, a new way of thinking and new programs. Multiple languages in fact! Don't waste time trying to prove that 'I can remember x y or z' all the time. You'll retain it better by using it more anyways, so just GOOGLE IT, do it. Retain it.</p>
                
                <h4>Take a deep breath.</h4>
                <p>Coding and programming deal with the minutia of things. You might be missing a ; or a : somewhere and a whole section of code won't work. Take a deep breath. You'll find it.</p>

                <h4>Patience is Key!</h4>
                <p>When you first start, and as you dive further in, remember to maintain patience. Patience with yourself, and patience with the process. It can be hard to take it slow. You're ready to make something amazing! But you have to learn the small steps first.</p>
 
                <p>It can be beyond tempting to jump forward, and try to outpace yourself to make that 'cool' next step thing right? Well, you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't learn the fundamentals the right way first.</p>

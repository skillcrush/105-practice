                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>
 
                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
 
                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
 
                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <h4>Never Give Up!</h4>
                <p>I know that learning something completely new as coding can be VERY intimidating, especially when this is something that is very different from what you went to school for and/or your making a life changing decision and changing careers when you're in your 40's, married with two kids in school, during a pandemic (that's me).
                    Never give up on something that you want to achieve. You have to go through challenges when learning something new. In our case that's coding like HTML, CSS, GitHub and many other programs. We have to go through many growing pains to get comfortable in our new head space of knowledge.
                    Keep at it even if you feel that it's wrong, because when it's all said and done. You will be able to provide something for yourself and family that you weren't able to before.
                    Never give up! Fight the fight! Believe in yourself! You've got this!

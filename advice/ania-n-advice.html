        <h4>Don't be too hard on yourself</h4>
        <p>
          When you start programming it can be very owerwhelming and you might
          get stressed by the amout of new things you have to learn. I was so
          stressed that I felt a lot of guilt when I wasn't learning every day
          after work.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now I know that balance is very important. With learning too much I
          got very stressed and tired but I noticed that when I take a break and
          relax sometimes I get the best ideas or solutions to the problems. So
          don't be too hard on yourself!
        </p>

        <h4>Don't look too much into 'Frontend Developer Roadmap Graphs</h4>
        <p>
          At the beginning everything was very new and I was often searching on
          the internet for a roadmap to become Frontend Developer to see what
          skills I need to learn. Unfortunately the graphs were huge and they
          really owerwhelmed me and triggered my imposter syndrome.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now that I work as a frontend Developer I know you don't necessery
          need all the skills from the start. Some of them are already outdated,
          some can be learned in quite short amount of time and some are just
          not used at my company. I feel that it's more important to have strong
          foundations than know just a little of every tool possible. The more
          you work as a developer the faster you learn new tools anyway.

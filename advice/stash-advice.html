                <h3>Let your love conquer your fear.</h3>
                <p>Learning a new skill like programming can seem overwhelming. It's important to move forward, little by little, and celebrate your progress, however small. Let your passion for technology trump your fear of failure.</p>
 
                <h3>Show compassionate toward yourself.</h3> 
                <p>You have taken the initiative to learn a new skill, and that takes a lot of courage. Tell yourself, "It's not difficult; it's just unfamiliar." It's not a race; be patient and allow yourself the time to grow as your learn (and re-learn) each concept. </p>
 
                <h3>Determination is key.</h3>
                <p>No matter how long it takes, don't let yourself give up. Stay consistent in your coding practice. If a lesson gets frustrating, take a break, or even sleep on it, and come back to it the next day. Rest rejuvenates the mind and helps you to see the situtation differently. This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process. If you enjoy coding, <span>learn to love the process.</span></p>

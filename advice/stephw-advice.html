                <h4>You might doubt yourself and that's <span> OK!</span> </h4>
                <p>Learning to code can be challenging. I've had many thoughts and feelings of confusion, anxiety, and insecurity. It's normal for new coders to feel confused about what they're learning, anxious if they're making the right choice and wonder if they're smart enough to be succesful in this field. </p>

                <p>Just remember, every programmer started as a beginner. Try not to compare your beginning to other's endings.</p>

                <h4>5 minutes is all you need</h4>
                <p>Learning to code is like learning a new language. The more exposure and repetition you have, the better ... even if it's small continuous bits. Studies show that even passive exposure can enhance learning!</p>

                <p>Small, consistent baby steps will gain you more ground than inconsistent, exhausting leaps -- And that 5 minute action will make your dreams come true.  </p>

            <h1>Hi, my name is Rossana Rojas and I have some advice for you!</h1>

                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before.
                  It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development,
                  something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you
                  have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you
                  to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming
                  language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that
                  the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical
                  part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes
                  learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you
                  don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <h4>Give yourself some mangos!</h4>
                <p>Some time ago I went to a talk given by a researcher that decided to change her carreer. She said that
                  the process, as difficult as it can be, requieres one to give oneself motivation and little rewards when
                  achieving something, no matter how small this "something" might be. So go ahead and treat yourself with
                  something you like once you manage to write that wireframe for a new website, for example!

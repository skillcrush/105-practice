          <h4>Be prepared to be confused!?</h4>
          <p>When you start programming your first webpage, you are doing
          something you've never done before.  It's a new challenge with
          a lot of obstacles ahead. Don't give up when you first get confused,
          you can walk through your steps, talk to an expert, or take a break to
          refresh your thoughts.</p>

          <p>Confusion is a sign that you are headed in the right direction, even
          if you feel you are lost at the time. It's a sign that you have engaged
          in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology combined. It
          is also time to dig deep and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

          <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
          <p> When you are learning a new technology, you go through this
          uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking
          at is doing this <span>THING</span>, but you don't understand <span>HOW</span>
          exactly it's happening.</p>

          <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology.  It
          is absolutely a critical part of the learning process. So embrace it! </p>

                <h4>Don't let the novelty scare you</h4>
                <p>Most likely you haven't done something like this before and when you first start, it can be overwhelming how much there is to learn. Break it down piece by piece and face each section head on. Get your fundamentals down before you tackle the big stuff.</p>

                <p>Just because it's new doesn't mean you can't do it or even that it's difficult. There's a learning curve for everything, you just need to work through it.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="half-width" id="advice2">
                <h4>Go beyond the assignment</h4>
                <p>Want to add something to your project that you haven't learned yet? Go out and figure out how to do it. Try and fail and try again. Get into the weeds and read up on it. It might take longer and you'll get frustrated, but it's the best way to learm.</p>

                <p>You'll learn way more and understand it more thoroughly if you find the answer yourself than if someone gave you the answer outright.</p>

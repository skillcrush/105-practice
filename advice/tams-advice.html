            <div class="advice one">
                <h4>You've made it this far!</h4>
                <p>Trust me, I can't believe I have either. But man it feels good! I am so looking forward to where
                    this career can take me! I refuse to let myself down in learning this as best as I can.
                    (With being a single mother of two, that is!). So if I can make 24 hours stretch enough to learn
                    to code, so can you!
                </p>
 
                <p>I really love feeling part of a community where everyone is having fun overcoming problems! It feels
                    great having interest in such a powerful thing, which is computers. 
                    Working on this assignment shows me that I have made the best decision yet. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="advice two">
                <h4>And it feels like it's only the beginning!</h4>
                <p>Just like you, I am commited to learning to code. With commitment alone, comes several characteristics that we should be proud of.
                    I see that it seperates you from others and puts you on a different path. But which is better? The destination in which we are trying to reach?
                    Or the journey?
                </p>
                <p>I don't feel like coding has a hidden meaning, and
                    it has become less intimidating the more that I become familiar with it. I will continue feeling deserving of
                    achieving the absolute most that I can, and so should you! So my Skillcrush class-mate, you are not alone.<br> <span>Stay the course!</span></p>

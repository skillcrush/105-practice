            <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
            <p>When you find yourself stuck or find that you've messed things up, don't get discouraged. Having to untangle and clean up the mess gives you a much better understanding of the way things work than if you never make a mistake. As frustrating as it might be, the challenge of fixing mistakes is a great opportunity to learn.</p>
            <p>Sometimes when you get really confused, one option is to start from scratch. You'll usually realize where you went wrong and you'll have a better understanding of the process.</p>

            <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <h4>Commit, Commit, Commit.</h4>
                <p>You can't learn a whole field by giving it one day a week. You can't be a great entrepreneur working 1 hour a day. Life is about creating purpose. Try your best, and your best will be given back to you.</p>

                <p>i've quit my job at a costco after 5 years, committed to learning software development in as many forms as i can. I worked in a corporate buying office, an accounting office, on a forklift, and multiple warehouse positions. It's a rough rough life in corporate retail so i have decided to taket that effort which i was putting into being great there, now, into myself to create something better for myself.</p>

                <h4>Keep your head up</h4>
                <p>It's all just learning, and working. There is always a task to be done, and it is up to you to understand the priority in which said tasks hold.</p>

                <p>Once you can maintain an understanding and execution of that priority the rest is clockwork.</p>

                <p>Do everything you can to understand what is in front of you, and if you don't get it, don't get frusterated. Either do proper research on the web, or just take a few minutes to walk away and have a breather.</p>

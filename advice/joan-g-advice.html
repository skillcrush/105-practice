                <h4>You are Awesome!</h4>
                <p>You have made the best decision on learning new skills! This is just the first step towards a bright future! </p>

                <p>Learning tech sometimes is confusing, and you don't seem to understand it all. Is okay to feel stuck! I have been there. Is totally normal, you are learning something completely new! If you don't understand something, ask your instructors, other students and look into the resources, they will be of great help.</p>

                <h4>Never stop learning!</h4>
                <p>No matter where you are at your career, never stop learning. Learning new skills or reinforcing the ones that you already know will help you more than you think.</p>

                <p>It's very important to maintain an active brain! An active brain helps with your memory and it makes it easier to learn new skills. </p>

                <p>Practice makes perfect! Practice, practice and more practice! Don't seem to get some coding right, no worries! Practice it until you do and never be afraid to ask for help!</p>

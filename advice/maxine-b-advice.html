                <h4>Seize the right opportunity…</h4>
                <p>There are always opportunities to give up, put the work away, and reinforce negative thought patterns. It is difficult to start from scratch and learn a completely new set of skills. Sometimes even the simplest goals feel impossibly out of reach.</p>
 
                <p>While feelings of helplessness or confusion are never fun, allow yourself the adventure of exploration. There are many more opportunities for learning and understanding just by showing up than yielding to negative beliefs. Look forward to and engage with the excitement of a learning opportunity!</p>
 
                <h4>…and step away.</h4>
                <p>Remember - you are still a human. You’re not a robot-coding-machine (yet) without feelings and needs.</p>
 
                <p>Give your eyes a break: Schedule stretches. Drink water. Enjoy that second cup of coffee.</p>
 
                <p>While you are building these new connections and enriching your inner world, don’t push too hard. It is important to take care of yourself to avoid burnout and to be able to enjoy life away from a computer.</p>

                <p>Balance, baby! You got this :)</p>

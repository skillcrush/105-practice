                <h4>Practice Makes Better</h4>
                <p>That's not the way the saying went when I first heard it, and I'm pretty sure that's true for you too. Practice is supposed to make PERFECT. Right? Wrong. In any endeavor, you will never achieve perfect, nor should that be your end goal. Why? Because it doesn't exist. Learning and growing and life-long journeys. You may never achieve perfection, but if you continue to work hard at something, you will never stop getting better either.</p>

                <h4>Rest Days are Mandatory</h4>
                <p>So if practice makes better, does that mean you need to practice and practice and practice at every free moment that you have? Absolutely not. You need to take breaks. Just like athletes require rest days so that their muscles can recover and actually make gains, artists and developers need rest days too! The brain is a pretty important muscle. How can you expect it to perform at 100% all hours of the day? If you're starting to feel overworked and burned out, it might be a sign that you need to treat yourself.</p>

            <div class="advice">
                <h4>Just Do It!</h4>
                <p>If you keep putting off and putting off starting a new life adventure because you feel like you're not ready, you will NEVER achieve your goals. Because the truth is that we will never "feel ready" enough. Things happen when you make the conscious decisions and take the steps to make them happen. Moving across the country, going back to school, signing up with Skillcrush - all of these goals start when you decide to take the first step. If you're hesitating, believe me. You just gotta do it.</p>

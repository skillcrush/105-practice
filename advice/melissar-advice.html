                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                    <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                    <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Read, re-read and read some more</h4>
                    <p>Read and review class materials and videos multiple times and the information will eventually make sense.</p>

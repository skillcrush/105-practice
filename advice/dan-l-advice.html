                <p>When going through course material, make sure to take the time to save and organize all linked material to a respective Bookmarks folder in your browser. </p>
 
                <p>Make sure to explore these materials in tandem with the course subject so you have a greater depth of understanding.</p>

                <p>Check out the student community on the Skillcrush Slack channel for guidance and questions you may have.</p>

                 <h4>Be Patient!</h4>
                <p>Sometimes you may feel stuck or lost on a subject. Make sure if you encounter something that frustrates you that you take some time to step away from the work for a bit to recharge and refocus.</p>
 
                <p>Don't feel bad if you need to go back and review some of the topics you've already gone through in order to get a better grasp.</p>

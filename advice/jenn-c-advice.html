                    <h4>Don't be afraid to get stared.</h4>
                    <p>One of the biggest challenges in any endeaver is taking the first step. When writing a book, it's recording the first words. When creating a painting, it's placing the first strokes.</p>

                    <p>Similar to learning a spoken language, learning to program is diving into a new world where the words don't make sense, and everything is new an different, but the best way to learn is to submerse yourself and to be okay asking questions or getting help.</p>

                    <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                    <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>
 
                    <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <div class="half-width">
                    <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                    <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
 
                    <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
 
                    <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                    <h4>Keep going...</h4>
                    <p>The biggest piece of advice I can give is to keep trying. If something doesn't work out, try something else. If your eyes start to cross, step away and come back later. If all else fails, you can start over. None of these things are mistakes, simply growing pains.</p>

                    <p><strong>P.S. I will always wish I had started sooner, but the main point is that I started!</strong></p>

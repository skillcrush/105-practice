                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                    <p>When you start programming your first web app you're doing something that you've never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity and, in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>
 
                    <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you're heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you've engaged in the problem solving pursuit that's technology - and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>
 
                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                    <p>When you're learning a new technology, whether you're learning to write your first programming language or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you're looking at is doing this THING - but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
 
                    <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology and, in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>
 
                    <p>When you encounter a new programming language, your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a LOT of code - even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <h4>Sticking with it is essential!</h4>
                    <p>Learning a new technology can be frustrating. At times, you may think you'll never understand how to program web apps. You may even feel like giving up.</p>

                    <p>Don't quit. Take a break - exercise, play with your dog, sing in the shower or just stream a show you love and chill on the couch. When you feel refreshed, head back to your computer and give it another try.</p>

                    <p>You can do it! Believe it or not, you were born to progam web apps - and your first one is going to turn out GREAT.</p>

                <h4>Practice In Intervals!</h4>
                <p>The old adage that practice makes perfect is true, as is use it or lose it. Remember to consistently practice your new skills to gain familiarity and expand your knowledge base.</p>
 
                <p>However, it can feel very overwhelming to learn a new language and immeditately try to jump into a project, no matter how simple that project may seem on the surface. There's going to be a lot of things you won't know yet. Trial and error will get you there, as well as using online resources for reference, but it will take time and no doubt be frustrating. But it's okay, just remember to attack a project in consumable bites and take breaks.</p>

                <h4>Don't give up too easily!</h4>
                <p>When you start learning coding skills, there is so much new information to process. Only a superhuman could learn everything from first try. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>
 
                <p>Confusion, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Always google!</h4>
                <p>...then google some more! When you face a problem and are about to lose your shit, just try your friend Google. In 95% of the cases someone has had the same problem before. And typically the problem is caused by a typo or something else so simple that it makes you laugh. Also, everyone goes through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity awaits.</p>

                <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write your first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally understand what it's doing.</p>

                <h4>Create a schedule!</h4>
                <p>The best way to stay on track with your Skillcrush classes is by blocking out a time that fits your schedule to work on your class. Stick to this schedule as best as you can! </p>

                <p>When things get busy, it's easy to talk yourself out of working on your class, but if you have a schedule it's easier to stick to your goal of finishing!</p>

                <h4>Remember why you started!</h4>
                <p>When things get really challenging it can be hard to stick to it! Remember why you started! Is it for a new career? To learn skills for a promotion? To make more money? Keep these at the front of your brain to remind you to keep going!</p>

                <p>Read some motivating books to build your confidence. I really liked <span>Grit</span>, <span>Deep Work</span>, and <span>Atomic Habits</span>. These helped me get in the right mindset for learning challenging things.</p>

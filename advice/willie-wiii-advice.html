                <p>Google and YouTube seems to be my best friend during this journey. I found that when I didn't fully understand lessons, I could watch a few videos and read artices from differents sources that might explain lessons in a way that is more digestable to me. Usually when I return back to the lesson, I have a better grasp of the material.</p>

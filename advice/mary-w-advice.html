                     <h4>Relax</h4>
                     <p>Perhaps some people work better under pressure, but not all of us. Personally, I am not at my best when I am stressed. It's harder to rememer things and solutions to problems remain evasive. That doesn't make for very productive learning time, so I have learned ways to relax. Sometimes that means I have to take care of something else that is concerning me before I start, but often it's a simple as a few deep breaths and a glass of hot tea. Find things that work for you! Essential oils, mediation, or maybe just having a quiet room might help. </p>

                     <p>Mindset is important. So if things feel exceptionally hard one day, don't panic. Take some deep breaths, find a way to relax, and try again. You've got this!</p>

                     <h4>Take Breaks</h4>
                     <p>Memory advice borrowed from Jim Quik's fabulous book <span> Limitless </span> - Taking breaks while studing can help you remember more. Apparently most people tend to remember things better from the beginning and the end of when they start studing, while the middle may get more fuzzy. By taking breaks every 45 minutes to an hour, we can bring the beginning and the end of each session closer together. What a smart and simple tool! </p>

                     <p>Sooo if you are like me skipping one day and then fitting as much as possile into the next, try taking breaks every so often. Give your brain some time to digest what you are learning.</p>

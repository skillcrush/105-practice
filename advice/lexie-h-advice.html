                <h4>Get your mindset right!</h4>
                <p>Embrace a growth mindset over a fixed mindset. Don't believe that you were born with a fixed set of abilities. Believe that you can learn any new skill you want to learn. You can succeed at anything if you work hard, practice diligently, and never give up.</p>

                <h4>Time means nothing!</h4>
                <p>It doesn't matter how long it takes you to learn something. There is no expiration date on learning a new skill. There is no age too old to achieve something new.</p>
                
                <h4>Comparison is the thief of joy!</h4>
                <p>Don't compare your beginning to someone else's ending. Don't be discouraged if someone else picks up a new skill more quickly than you do. You have to make a lot of bad or mediocre things in this world before you can make good things. And no matter what you think you know, you're not seeing the full story when it comes to another's successes or failures. So don't bother comparing yourself with anyone else.</p>

                <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
                <p>Being confused is normal. Being confused means you will learn something new.</p>

                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right direction.</p>

                <h4>Continue to challenge yourself</h4>
                <p>Sometimes it seems hard and maybe you will take a while to learn something or move forward. That's okay. You WILL get it and once you do it'll be easy.</p>

                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

                <p>Always learn new things. Never stop pushing yourself to understand the things that don't make sense right now.</p>

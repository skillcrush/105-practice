                <h4>Take a deep breath!</h4>
                <p>Sometimes it feels overwhelming, but remember that you are smart and you will eventually get it.</p>
                <p>Google stuff, check forums, search for your answer. Sometimes you need another opinion or a pair of eyes.</p>

                <h4>Take it slow</h4>
                <p>It's tempting to try to fly through the lessons, but the slower you go, and the more attention to detail that you pay to all the little things, the better you will understand.</p>
                <p>Slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.</p>

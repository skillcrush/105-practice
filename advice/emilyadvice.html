        <h3>Find the time</h3>
        <p>The hard truth is, that if you don't put in the time, you aren't
            goint to learn how to code. If you are not consistently learning,
            you are not going to learn how to code. So put in the time. Find
            an extra hour each day, no matter how tired you are.

        <h3>Finding time to code</h3>
        <p>I understand that life is busy, especially when you have kids,
            but here are some suggestions for finding time to code</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Turn off the T.V.</li>
            <p>Either turn it off completely, or stop watching an hour
                earlier than you do, and get coding!</p>
            <li>Give something up</li>
            <p>That's right. Do you have an habits that may not be healthy,
                or benefitial to you in the long run? Do you drink alcohol 
                on a regular basis, or every night? Try giving it up, or greatly
                reducing your drinking, and instead....Code!</p>
        </ul>

        <div class="difficult">
        <h3>Learning something new is difficult!</h3>
       
        <p>So give yourself a break! If you you spend an hour or more learning
            4 or 5 out of 7 days, reward yourself! Tell yourself how great you are. 
            Buy yourself a drink and celebrate the new synapses in your brain!</p>

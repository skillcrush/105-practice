            <h4>Don't get overwhelmed</h4>
            <p>You're learning a lot, so try not to overwhelm yourself by taking in too much at a time. Brain breaks are good!</p>

            <p>If you feel like you're losing touch, walk away for a day or two. Practice your favorite hobby, spend time with family, etc. You'll come back more refreshed and ready to focus.</p>

            <h4>Believe in yourself</h4>
            <p>It sounds silly and cliché but believe that you can do this. This is, for me, the hardest thing! I constantly need to remind myself that I'm smart and capable enough to learn this stuff and make my goals a reality. Look at yourself in the mirror and give yourself a pep talk. Make a vision board. Keep a list of your other, non-tech accomplishments as a reminder of what you can achieve when you work at something. Anything to remind yourself that you are awesome.</p>

            <h4>Find a community</h4>
            <p>Whether it's the Skillcrush Slack group, a Facebook group, a Meetup, or just a group of supportive friends, find a community to support you. You will have questions, and you will have doubts. Having people there to bounce ideas around and give you a little boost is crucial to success.</p>

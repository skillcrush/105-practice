              <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
              <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing some that you have
                never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity, and in the case of
                software development, something so specific that it's probably never been done
                before. </p>
                  <p> Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right
                    direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem solving pursuit that is
                    math and technology and that it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going
                    because clarity awaits. </p>
                    <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role. </h4>
                    <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are learning to write our
                      first programming language, or just the latest framework, you go through this
                      uncomfortable phase where you know that the code your are looking at is doing
                      this <span>THING </span>but you don't understand <span>HOW </span>exactly it's happening. </p>
                      <p>this is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's
                      a critical part of the process.</p>
                      <p>You see when you encounter a new prgramming language
                        part of your learning process includes learning to train your eye. The
                          way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you dont
                          totally understand what it's dong. </p>.

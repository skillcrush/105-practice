                <h4>Practice is your friend!</h4>
                <p>The old adage "Practice makes perfect" stays tried and true here folks. The best way to do that is with practice. I have leanred that if you just learn it and don't practice then you are setting yourself up for failure.</p>
 
                <p>Practice therefore is absolutely essential in the learning of a new computer language or web appllication. The more you practice the better you become at it, it is definitely like learning a new language.</p>

                <h4>Repetition plays an important role.</h4>
                <p>Repeatedly doing the same thing and making a routine is what will get you completely acclimated to coding. Once you learn a language the more you practice it the better you become and repetiton is why that happens.</p>
 
                <p>Just like when learning a new language like French, using it and repeatedly practicing it leads to fluidity.</p>
 
                <p>You will eventually notice how much better you have become at the language and will be glad that you stuck to you guns and made repetition and pratice your favorite tools!</p>

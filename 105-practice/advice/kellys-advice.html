          <h4>Embrace Frustration!</h4>
          <p>When you're learning a new skill, chances are a lot of it will come easily at first. Then you'll hit a wall, where nothing seems to be working and no matter how hard you try you just can't get it right. Don't panic!</p>
          <p>When you hit a plateau in your learning process, it's normal to feel frustrated. Think of this phase as a sign that you're "levelling up"! Eventually you'll master the concept that had you stuck, and you'll progress again in leaps and bounds. Until the next plateau!</p>
          <h4>Take a step back.</h4>
          <p>During those periods of frustration, don't be afraid to take a step back.</p>
          <p>Google it, take steps to troubleshoot on your own, and ask for help from friends and mentors. But sometimes the best thing to do is walk away.</p>
          <p>Work on something else for a day or two, then return to the problem with a clear mind. A lot of the time, the solution will present itself!</p>

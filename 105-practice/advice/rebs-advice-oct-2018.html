		  <p>Being "technical" is something you have to work at, everyday. Little learning spurts here and there quickly add up to make you a master at whatever coding language you prefer. You've gotta start somewhere.
			Think of where you will be in a year if you start RIGHT NOW:) Remember: BABY STEPS!</p></div>

				<h4 class="tips">Find Your Nerd Tribe</h4>
			  <p>Trust me, you don't want (nor have) to go this alone. Google local coding Meetups, search for tech groups in your area, or start your own!
				We all need a little help from our friends from time to time. Finding a community of like-minded folks will help you stay motivated and discover new tricks of the trade.
				In no time, I bet you will have peeps messaging you, sending you coding gifs, and begging you to host a coder pot-luck. Snacks + code = FUN!

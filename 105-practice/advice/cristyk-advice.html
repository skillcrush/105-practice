			<h4>Go easy on yourself!</h4>
			<p>Once you learn a few HTML tags and Git commands, it's easy to focus on how much more you need to learn. You might even compare  yourself to people who have a lot more experience.</p>

			<p>It's ok to be exactly where you are! Try to keep in mind how far you've come! Just a few weeks ago, you didn't know anything about HTML, CSS, or Git. And now here you are, giving advice to others. :)</p>

			<h4>Celebrate the small wins</h4>
			<p>Learning to code is a BIG DEAL. Celebrate every step of the way, even if it seems super small.</p>

			<p>Remembered what to write in the head section of your HTML without looking? Get yourself a cupcake! Got your images to appear? Pet a kitten! Successfully forked and cloned a repo? Throw yourself a PARTAY and invite me!</p>

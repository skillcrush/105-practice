			<h3>Confusion: Friend or Foe?</h3>
			<p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge, a new opportunity. This is when confusion can become a friend that guides you or the foe that makes you quit.</p>
			<p>Everytime I got stuck during my skillcrush experience, I knew I was in total charge of how I wanted my journey to go. Did I want to continue fighting with the confusion of a brand new lesson I did not understand or did I use my confusion to my advantage knowing I would eventually understand the new concept and make it throught the other side? I chose the latter.</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology and it's a critical part of the process.</p>

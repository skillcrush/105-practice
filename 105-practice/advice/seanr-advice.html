            <h4>Keep Pushing Through and Practice.....Don't stop!</h4>
            <p>Since I started this program I noticed how procrastination creeps in and can take a strangle hold on tring to learn something new.</p>
            <p>In the beginning everything is shiny and new. You get in a groove and the first few lessons fly by.</p>
            <p>Then life throws you a few roadblocks. So you decide to take a day or 2 off from learning. Tomorrow turns into the day after and then the day after that. Before you know it 2 months have gone by since you last looked at one of your lessons.</p>
            <p> Don't fall into this trap. No matter what happens make the time to learn. If you don't you will perpetually be relearning your basics over and over again.</p>
            <p>Try and find someone to practice with. A friend, coworker, or even someone in the skillcrush slack channel. Also, there are meetup groups and developer communities that support this as well. This is a great way to get involved in a new community and a great way to meet other beginner's like yourself.</p>

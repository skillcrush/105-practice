                <h4>Stay the Course</h4>
                <p>Stick to the schedule you created and look over it weekly. Yes, there are times you will fall behind, but get back on track ASAP.</p>

                <p>If you get stuck, read and re-read the lesson, review the videos, google, and refer to any links provided in the lesson. Try to troubleshoot the issue on your own first and if you're still unable to resolve, post it in Slack (the support is phenomenal - team Skillcrush is serious about students succeeding).</p>

                <p>Finally, practice, practice, practice. Besides working on the lessons, it's a good idea to practice by creating a project of your own.</p>

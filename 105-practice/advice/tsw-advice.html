			and healthy. Here are some tips to make your time with <span class="Skillcrush">Skillcrush </span>

		<h3>Mind</h3>
			<p><i class="material-icons" style="color:#247BA0">undo</i><i class="material-icons" style="color:#247BA0">redo</i><span class="emphasis">Typos Are Your Best Teachers</span><br>
			A lot of "mistakes" happen due to simple typing or syntax errors.  When
			something doesn't happen the way you think it should - the very firs thing
			to check is if everything is spelt correctly and in the correct or order.
			Think of typos as little teaching moments sprinkled throughout your day.</p>
			<p><i class="material-icons" style="color:#247BA0">create</i><span class="emphasis">Make Your Own Cheat Sheets</span><br>
			<span class="Skillcrush">Skillcrush </span>provides some useful cheat sheets that should absolutely be used for reference.  But try creating your own as well.  The act of organizing and summarizing in written form what you have just learned helps cement input
			in your memory.  And if you want to spend some time to make them pretty - you are getting some design practice too. </p>
			<p><i class="material-icons" style="color:#247BA0">warning</i><span class="emphasis">Prepare For Obstacles</span><br>
			It is absolutely guaranteed that at some point, you will get frustrated,
		 	confused, and feel like quitting.  So get ready for that moment!  Make a
	 		promise to yourself that when it happnes, you will first take a break, and
		 	then some basic problem-solving techniues: backup and redo, use Google to
	 	 	find a tutorial somewhere, or use the <span class="Skillcrush">Skillcrush </span>Student Community on Slack
	 		to ask for help. </p>

		<h3>Body</h3>
			<p><i class="material-icons" style="color:#247BA0">event_seat</i><span class="emphasis">Work In Comfort</span><br>
				Take time to set up your workspace so that it supports your health in <thead>
				long run.  You don't need to spend a lot of money, but a few investments
				here and there are cheaper than carpal tunnel surgery.
				<a href="https://www.uhs.umich.edu/computerergonomics">Here is a good
				place to start</a></p>
			<p><i class="material-icons" style="color:#247BA0">alarm</i><span class="emphasis">Take Regular Breaks</span><br>
			 Use an app, browser extension, or even just a kitchen timer - but set up
			 and take regular, timed breaks.  They don't have to be long, but taking
			 time to stand up, walk around, and rest your eyes and hands will increase
			 focus, productivity, and capacity for learning.  Plus, it just feels good.</p>
			<p><i class="material-icons" style="color:#247BA0">opacity</i><span class="emphasis">Drink Water</span><br>
				It's okay to start your day with a cup or two of coffee.  But try to drink
				water instead of caffeine throughout the day.  We all know we shoudl, so just
			 do it.  At the very least, drinking water means that you'll need to take more
			 breaks - which is also good for you.</p>

		<h3>Soul</h3>
			<p><i class="material-icons" style="color:#247BA0">favorite</i><span class="emphasis">Make It Fun</span><br>
				Create a specific, but joyful environment when <span class="Skillcrush">Skillcrushing. </span> Find a favorite pen, a fun notebook, or an inspiring playlist - and save them for your Skillcrush time only. Think of your Skillcrush sessions as a personal treat and it will be easier to persevere when the going gets tough. </p>
			<p><i class="material-icons" style="color:#247BA0">hourglass_full</i><span class="emphasis">Set Input Rather than Output Goals</span><br>
				In <span class="Skillcrush">Skillcrush</span>, as with just about everything in life, some tasks just take longer than others.  And it can be discouraging if you feel that you aren't
				keeping up or moving "fast enough".  So instead, set a goal of working on <span class="Skillcrush">Skillcrush </span> an appropriate-for-you amount of time each day or week.  That way, you are set up for success every day - no matter what you accomplish. </p>
			<p><i class="material-icons" style="color:#247BA0">cake</i><span class="emphasis">Celebrate and Savor</span><br>
				When you do reach a milestone, solve a vexing problem, or just learn something
				new and cool - celebrate!! Get up and do a dance!  Play a round of Kitchen Karaoke.
				Write down your victory on a small piece of paper and put it a Jar of Awesome to
				read later.  Post it on social media or in the <span class="Skillcrush">Skillcrush </span>Student Community.
				Savor all of your victories and take joy in this journey. </p>

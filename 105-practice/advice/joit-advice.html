                <h4>Let It Sink In!</h4>
                <p>When you're learning anything, particularly something technical, you have to take your time to give the knowledge time to sink in.  We live in a society where people expect for things to happen instantly.  And some things can - things like Google searches or text messages.  But, learning takes time and there's no way around that.</p>

                <p>It's also a great idea to practically <i>apply</i> what you've learned.  Practical application, learning by doing, makes concepts concrete therefore <b>improving <u>understanding</u> and <u>retention</u></b> of those concepts.</p>

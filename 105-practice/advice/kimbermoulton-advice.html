      <h1>Hi, my name is Kimber and I have some advice for you!</h1>
    </header>

        <div class="half-width">

            <h4>Confusion is your friend!</h4>
            <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing
              something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge,
              a new opprotunity, and in the case of software development,
              something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>

            <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the right
                direction. It's a signal that you have engaged in the problem
                solving pursuit that is math and technology and it's time for you
                to dig deeper and keep going because clairty awaits.</p>

          <div class="half-width">

            <h4>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h4>
            <p>When you are learning a new technology, you go through this uncomfortable
              phase where you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING
              but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening. </p>

            <p><em>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology,
              and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</em></p>

            <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language part of your
              learning process includes learning to train your eye. The way to train
              your eye is to read a good deal of code even when you don't totally
              understand what it's doing.</p>

          </div>

        <div class="full-width" id="conclusion">

            <h4>That's really great advice.</h4>
            <p>It really is! Typing this all out actually made me feel a lot
                better about the confusion and frustation I've been feeling
                during my journey through these courses... I'm learning too, and
                I am here to tell you that you can do this! And yes... it's hard,
                and yes, it's supposed to be.</p>

            <p>Keep pushing and eventually it's all going to click. I promise!
              You will be suprised how quickly everything starts to come together
              and how soon these concepts will become second nature. Above all else:
              practice, practice and practice some more!</p>

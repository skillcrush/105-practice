                <h3>Confusion is your friend!</h3>
                <p>When you start programming your first web app you are doing 
                something that you have never done before. It's a new challenge,
                a new opportunity, and in the case of software development, 
                something so specific that it's probably never been done before.</p>
 
                <p>Confusion, therefore, is a sign that you are heading in the
                right direction! It's a signal that you have engaged in the 
                problem solving pursuit that is math and technology and that 
                it's time for you to dig deeper and keep going because clarity 
                awaits. Confusion means that you are thinking! The more you are 
                exposed to the same things, the faster you can pick it up. Have
                faith that you will learn what you need to in order to succedd!</p>
 
                <h3>Suspended disbelief plays an important role.</h3>
                <p>When you are learning a new technology, whether you are 
                learning to write your first programming language, or just the 
                latest framework, you go through this uncomfortable phase where
                 you know that the code you are looking at is doing this THING 
                 but you don't understand HOW exactly it's happening.</p>
 
                <p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new 
                technology, and it's a critical part of the process.</p>
 
                <p>You see when you encounter a new programming language 
                part of your learning process includes learning to train your 
                eye. The way to train your eye is to read a good deal of code 
                even when you don't totally understand what it's doing. You will learn.</p>
                
                <h2>BELIEVE IN YOURSELF!</h2>
                <p>You must believe in yourself. If others can do it? Why can't
                you? Nobody is smarter than you. Nobody is better than you. 
                Everyone started from zero. Learning takes time and hard work. 
                If you are willing to put in the work, you will succeed!</p>

                <h4>Wake up early!</h4>
                <p>If you make time for things that you want to do, you'll do them. I was trying to get stuff done after working all day and cooking dinner but I often found I was just too exhausted to focus. I started waking up a little earlier every day until I eventually started waking up at 5:30 most mornings. I now have time to exercise, shower, eat breakfast, and work on my coding all before I go to work!</p>
 
 
                <h4>Be persistent and patient</h4>
                <p>I personally always want to see the results of my efforts as soon as possible. I've had to accept that sometimes, you wont see the fruits of your labor immediately. The learning journey is part of the fun and should be enjoyed and not looked at as a chore.</p>
